Short example for USART2 or UART2 in STM32F411RE with the help of STM32 CubeMx. 
 
This project uses the USART2 to comunicate to the pc. You can download
TeraTerm to see the serial monitor and check that the communciation is       working

You can use the reset button in Nucleo Board to send from the MCU to the PC, and you can write to the serial monitor to send PC to MCU, and then MCU will answer back !
